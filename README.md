# Daily Fitness Tracker!



# How it works!
This tracker is designed to track and create your daily workouts. The homepage allows users to login or create an account. The next step from there is to make a workout and use the daily tracker to log your activity! All of this is done using the Meteor framework for NodeJS.


The Fitness Tracker has been deployed to Heroku [here](https://aqueous-anchorage-15023.herokuapp.com/).


# Technologies
The front end of this app uses ReactJS with React Router and Redux. For UI the app uses the Material-UI library and the React Grid System.

The back end uses Meteor for nodeJS. The app uses MongoDB for data and accounts-ui package for authentication and bcrypt-nodejs to hash passwords. It also uses an express server.



# Local Usage
To use locally make sure you clone the repo, have MongoDB and Meteor installed on your computer. Once that is done run a meteor npm install, then run meteor in your command line and got to localhost:3000 in your browser.
